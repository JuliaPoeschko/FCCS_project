# FCCS_project
This repository contains files created for the FCCS group project (topic: Spotify &amp; Covid-19).

The folder 'plot' contains all the plots that were created in our project. The image path always starts with a number, which explains whether the image belongs to the first, second or third analysis.

The folder 'data files' contains the original downloaded files of the mobility report and the stringency index. Please note that the charts and lyrics files are not included here, as they exceed the maximum file size. However, links to download these files are given in the report.

Note: The code written to prepare and analyze the data has not been uploaded (yet) due to extrem run times (some parts take > 8 hours and are therefore very time-intensive to prepare for uploading).
