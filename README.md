# FCCS_project
This repository contains files created for the FCCS group project (topic: Spotify &amp; Covid-19).

The folder 'plot' contains all the plots that were created in our project. The image path always starts with a number, which explains whether the image belongs to the first, second or third analysis.

The folder 'data files' contains all the original csv-files that we used to get data. The file 'stringency_index' was downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-stringency-index),'charts' from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/spotify-charts, the mobility reports from https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/, and 'lyrics' from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilnayak123/5-million-song-lyrics-dataset.
